I have decided to use a light-weight database and pre-populate it with data from 3rd party services.
This reduces the dependency application has on external sources as well as increases the performance of the app.
In production environment, there should be a separate service whose sole responsibility would be maintaining and
updating images currently stored in the database.

I have decided not to implement infinite-scroll, because in this particular case, I think paging would be more beneficial,
because it will allow the user to have a reference to where within the feed he currently is.

In this current implementation I've created a simple aggregatorService that is responsible for communicating with
3rd part API clients, as well as, imageRepository.
